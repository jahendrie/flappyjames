----------------------------------------
    1.  Description
----------------------------------------

    Flappy James is a Flappy Bird knockoff written C++/SDL2, except instead of
    a bird, you pilot the developer's beautiful face.



----------------------------------------
    2.  Requirements / Restrictions
----------------------------------------

    This game requires SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf to run or
    compile.  In addition, it requires a system (and drivers) capable of proper
    3D acceleration.

    To build this game, in addition to all of the SDL2 headers and libraries,
    you'll need a compiler and the standard C and C++ libraries and headers.  If
    you're able to compile anything at all you probably have these already.



----------------------------------------
    3.  Installation / Uninstallation
----------------------------------------

    To build, compile the program with 'make'.  It shouldn't take long, though
    obviously you'll need a C++ compiler.  If you're on any modern UNIX or Linux
    distro you should already have one, and if you don't, shame on you.  Go
    install GCC (gcc.gnu.org) right away.

    Currently, there is no actual 'installation' method for the program.  To run
    it, simply execute the binary from the directory in which it was built.


    Alternately, there do exist installers for both Windows and GNU/Linux
    (32-bit).  You can run one of those to install the game to a local
    directory, though you'll still need to execute the binary from its
    installation directory.  A shortcut takes care of this for the Windows
    install, and the linux installer can generate a shell script to execute the
    program to $HOME/bin if you'd like.
